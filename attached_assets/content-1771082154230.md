“ [nCounter](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/ncounter-analysis-system/ncounter-systems-overview/) allowed us to use flash-frozen paraffin embedded tissues that were a few years old, as well as didn’t have necessarily the best quality RNA, and still get really great data from it.”

“We are impressed with ease of use with which the [CosMx SMI](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/single-cell-imaging-overview/) enabled single cell spatial transcriptomics across various tissue types, even in archival FFPE tissue. The [high-plex protein assay](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/cosmx-protein-assays/cosmx-human-immuno-oncology-protein-panel/) makes the CosMx SMI a true multiomic solution. The CosMx SMI’s large capture area allows analysis from valuable clinical trial samples using tissue microarrays, enabling characterization of 100s of samples weekly.”

“The NanoString cancer panels, in general, and the [Breast Cancer 360 Panel](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/ncounter-assays-panels/oncology/breast-cancer-360/), in particular, in combination with the outstanding analytical tools developed by NanoString, provide straightforward, informatically-rich tools for characterization of the functional genomic landscape of breast cancer.”

“The [GeoMx DSP](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/geomx-dsp-overview/) is a workhorse in the lab for hypothesis testing… Complementing the single-neuron resolution of GeoMx, we rely on the [CosMx SMI](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/cosmx-smi-single-cell-imaging-de/) to achieve true subcellular spatial analyses and uncover cell-cell interactions… NanoString’s consistent advancements in panel development and plexity provide us with the confidence that they will continue empowering neuroscientists to explore complex questions.”

“There is a big movement underway to study the microenvironments of cancers in different organs because it is known that immunotherapy doesn’t work the same across different cancer types. [GeoMx](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/geomx-dsp-overview/) will be the key to us to understand those mechanisms. It will be able to see things we only dreamed about—it will be revolutionary”

“The [CosMx SMI](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/single-cell-imaging-overview/) complemented our efforts to generate organ atlases of the healthy human system together with our partners of the Human Cell Atlas project. It allowed us to visualize single-cell reference maps directly in organs. The scale of [1000-plex gene panel](https://brukerspatialbiology.com/products/cosmx-spatial-molecular-imager/cosmx-rna-assays/cosmx-universal-cell-characterization-rna-panel/) with image-guided cell segmentation makes the CosMx SMI, a unique platform for spatial genomics!”
