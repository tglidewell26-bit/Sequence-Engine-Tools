GeoMx, CellScape, and CosMx are complementary rather than competing: GeoMx is your flexible discovery and compartment-level spatial omics workhorse, CellScape is high-plex quantitative spatial proteomics at single-cell resolution over large areas, and CosMx is ultra–high-content single-cell/subcellular imaging for deep mechanistic questions.

Core modality and resolution
Platform	Primary readout	Resolution / scale	Typical tissue handling
GeoMx	RNA (whole-Tx, panels) + protein via barcoded probes
“Regional”/compartment and down to ~cellular AoIs; not true cell-by-cell counts
FFPE and fresh/fixed frozen sections, non‑destructive
CellScape	High‑plex protein (mIF cycles, spatial proteomics)
True single-cell across whole slides; high-res imaging (182 nm/pixel)
Standard histology slides, cyclic staining with integrated microfluidics
CosMx	RNA whole transcriptome + protein on same cells
Single-cell and subcellular (transcript spots in compartments)
FFPE and fresh frozen; in situ imaging, non‑destructive
Unique differentiators
GeoMx

Only platform in the portfolio designed for non‑destructive regional profiling of RNA and protein from user‑defined areas across the whole slide.

Very flexible assay menu (whole transcriptome atlas, cancer atlas, IO proteome, etc.) so you can move between broad hypothesis‑free discovery and focused panels.

Strength is compartmentalization: tumor vs stroma, invasive margin vs core, lesional vs perilesional, etc., using morphology- and marker-guided AOIs.

CellScape

Purpose‑built precise spatial proteomics with high‑plex cyclic mIF and quantitative single‑cell readouts over entire tissue sections.

Open ecosystem: uses off‑the‑shelf fluorescent antibodies (not locked to proprietary conjugates), with EpicIF signal‑removal chemistry and HDR imaging to keep quantitation clean across many cycles.

Integrated microfluidics and walk‑away automation for staining and cycling—engineered to be straightforward to adopt in translational and core environments.

CosMx

Only in situ imaging platform in this space offering whole transcriptome at single-cell spatial resolution plus same‑cell protein panel capability.

Multi‑modal segmentation: combines membrane/protein images with ML segmentation and transcript-based refinement to get accurate cell boundaries in complex tissues.
​

Designed explicitly for cell atlasing, cell–cell interaction mapping, and subcellular biomarker localization, where you care about where individual transcripts sit within cells.

Ideal use cases
When GeoMx is “best”

Early‑stage discovery on new tissues or indications, when you don’t yet know which cell types, regions, or gene sets matter and you want a broad, unbiased view across many ROIs.

Microenvironment and compartment questions: TME architecture, tertiary lymphoid structures, invasive margins, fibrosis gradients, CNS region comparisons, etc.

Program design where you plan a tiered workflow: use GeoMx to triage tissues and regions, then feed positive blocks/regions into CosMx or CellScape for deeper single‑cell work.
​

When CellScape is “best”

High‑plex protein‑centric questions where post‑transcriptional regulation, phospho‑states, or protein localization drive the biology (IO, pathology‑adjacent biomarker programs, pharmacodynamics).

Studies needing whole‑slide, quantitative single‑cell maps for dozens of markers across large cohorts—translational studies, tissue microarrays, or clinical trial biopsies.

Environments that already have strong IHC/mIF workflows and want to scale into true high‑plex with automation and open antibodies rather than jump straight into transcriptomics.

When CosMx is “best”

Deep mechanistic work and cell atlas building: defining rare cell states, neighborhood architectures, ligand–receptor pairs, and pathway usage at single-cell resolution.

Subcellular questions: nuclear vs cytoplasmic transcript distribution, synaptic localization in neuro, polarized epithelia, etc.

Follow‑up to GeoMx: starting with regional profiling then zooming into key regions with whole‑transcriptome single‑cell data for target discovery or biomarker refinement.
​

“Best research” fit by question type
If you phrase this as “what research is each platform best for,” you can think of it like a tiered funnel:

GeoMx – best for:

Tissue- and region‑level hypothesis generation across many samples and compartments.

Projects where FFPE compatibility and non‑destructive, morphology‑guided AOI selection are critical.

CellScape – best for:

High‑plex, quantitative protein biomarker programs with an eye toward translation and potential clinical fit (especially IO, oncology, immunology).

Situations where pathologists and translational scientists need intuitive images plus robust single‑cell protein data across the whole slide.

CosMx – best for:

Mechanistic and atlas‑level research where maximum information per cell (whole transcriptome ± protein) justifies deeper, more complex experiments.

Projects aiming at target discovery, cell–cell communication mapping, and fine‑grained cell state classification in complex tissues.

How to position the trio in a narrative
A common, clean story for customers:

Start with GeoMx on cohorts to map key compartments, identify high‑value regions, and build broad spatial transcriptomic/proteomic hypotheses.

Use CosMx on selected blocks/regions to resolve those hypotheses at single-cell and subcellular resolution, giving you detailed atlases and interaction maps.

Deploy CellScape when you want scalable, quantitative protein panels that operationalize those findings across larger cohorts or translational pipelines.
